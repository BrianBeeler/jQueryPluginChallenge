# jQueryPluginChallenge

# Task:
  - Create a jQuery plugin which will reverse the order of the text of a DOM element, alternate the colors of each character according to two color parameters which are passed to the plugin, and inject the reversed/colored text immediately after the original element.
  - Notes:
    - A simple test has been created to demonstrate the plugin; just open test.html in the browser
    - The plugin does not currently work as one might expect for jQuery selections of multiple elements. Because the prompt says 'text of "a" DOM element', I focused on making it work for any single element selection.
